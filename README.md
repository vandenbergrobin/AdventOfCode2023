# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to Advent of Code 2023! This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023. The challenges are organized into folders, with each folder named "day-(number)" corresponding to the challenge for that day. Inside each folder, you will find the following files:

- `problem.md`: This Markdown file describes the problem statement for the day's challenge.
- `solution.js`: This JavaScript file contains the solution code for the first part of the challenge. If you're looking for the original solution for the second part, you can use commits to find the previous solution.
- `input.txt`: This text file contains the input data required to run the solution code and obtain the answer.

## Using the Repository

To navigate through the challenges and their solutions, follow these steps:

1. Start by selecting the day you're interested in, for example, `day-1`.
2. In the folder for that day, open the `problem.md` file to read the problem statement.
3. To view the solution for the first part of the challenge, open the `solution.js` file.
4. If you want to see the original solution for the second part (before overwriting), you can use commits to find the previous solution. Commits are typically named with a message indicating the change, such as "Solve Day 2 Part 1" or something similar.
